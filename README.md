# hello-world

Greetings!

This is my hello-world repository--my first one ever!  I'm a beginner web-developer, hoping to get so good in the next year that I can get my first web-developer job.  I love websites and software, which is why I'm pursuing this path. I always run across things that I don't like, or that I would do differently, or that I could optimize if I JUST had the skills.  It took me too long to figure out what I wanted, but now I'm finally learning how to do what I feel has always been an area of interest for me. It also helps that with web-development and software engineering comes work flexibility and abundant opportunity.  

I've read a number of Medium articles from people who advanced their skills far enough in 4, 5, and 6 months that they were able to land jobs.  I work full time, with a long commute, and a 1-year old, plus homeowner responsibilities.  So, I'm giving myself a year to reach my goal, and I already have some basic education in HTML/CSS and introductory understanding of JavaScript and Python. I'm Looking forward to the rest of my journey!
